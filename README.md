```

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed
2. Run the entire stack:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start:

- PostgreSQL on port 5432
- Backend API on http://localhost:8000
- Frontend on http://localhost:5173 (run separately)

For the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 15+

#### Database Setup

Start PostgreSQL and create a database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE taskmap;
CREATE USER taskmap WITH PASSWORD 'taskmap123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE taskmap TO taskmap;
```

Or use Docker for just the database:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name taskmap-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=taskmap \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=taskmap123 \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=taskmap \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  postgres:15-alpine
```

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (Linux/Mac)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend runs at: http://localhost:8000
API docs at: http://localhost:8000/docs

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at: http://localhost:5173
